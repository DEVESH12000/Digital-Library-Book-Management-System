# Digital Library Book Management System

## Overview
This project is a console-based Digital Library Book Management System that allows librarians to add, view, search, update, and delete books from the library collection. The system ensures that each book has a unique ID and valid information for title, author, and availability status.

## Features
- **Add a Book:** Add a new book with details including Book ID, Title, Author, Genre, and Availability Status.
- **View All Books:** Display all books in the system.
- **Search Book:** Search for a book by its ID or Title.
- **Update Book:** Update details of an existing book.
- **Delete Book:** Remove a book from the system.
- **Exit System:** Close the application.

### Notes **Challenges Faced**
1. **Input Validation Complexity**
   - Ensuring `Book ID` uniqueness required careful state management.
   - Solution: Implemented a `HashMap` for O(1) lookups.

2. **Search Functionality**
   - Case-insensitive title search needed normalization (`toLowerCase()`).
   - Trade-off: Increased memory usage for faster searches.

3. **Maven Configuration**
   - Initial struggles with `pom.xml` dependencies.
   - Learned to use the Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`) for consistency.
